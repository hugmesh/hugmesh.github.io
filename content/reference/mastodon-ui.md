This repo is the **Mastodon UI** — an Angular micro-frontend
([native-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/native-federation)
**remote**) for the
[hugmesh.net](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-host-shell)
host shell. The host fetches and mounts this remote at runtime; the
`hugmesh-fe-gateway` (Spring Cloud Gateway) on the frontend Pi nodes exposes
it publicly at `/social/mastodon`.

Part of the HugMesh RPi 5 / x86_64 cluster built by
[hugmesh-generator](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-generator).
The sibling remotes live in their own repos:

## What this remote is

An Angular 22 + `@angular-architects/native-federation` single-project workspace.
Angular project name `mastodon`, root `.`, sourceRoot `src`, component prefix
`hug-mastodon`.

- **Remote name:** `mastodon`
- **Exposed federation module:** `./routes` → **`MASTODON_ROUTES`**
  (`src/app/mastodon.routes.ts`)

The host loads this remote at runtime via `loadRemoteModule('mastodon', './routes')`
and mounts the returned routes under `/social/mastodon`. The remote name
(`mastodon`) and the exposed key (`./routes`) are the stable public contract that
`loadRemoteModule()` depends on — never rename them without a coordinated host
update.

The shared federation surface (singleton libraries, `strictVersion` flags, the
RxJS skip list) is declared once in `federation-base.js` (`hugmeshRemote()`),
which is copied verbatim from the `hugmesh.net` reference. This keeps all
remotes in sync with the host; `federation.config.js` in this repo only declares
the remote name and `exposes` — it does not redefine shared libraries.

```js
// federation.config.js — the only repo-specific federation concerns
const { hugmeshRemote } = require('./federation-base');

module.exports = hugmeshRemote({
  name: 'mastodon',          // stable — matches the host's loadRemoteModule() call
  exposes: {
    './routes': './src/app/mastodon.routes.ts',  // stable — the federation contract
  },
});
```

`src/app/app.component.ts` (`hug-mastodon-root`) is a minimal standalone dev
shell used only when running this remote in isolation (`ng serve mastodon`). In
production the host federates `./routes` directly and the shell component is
never loaded.

### Architecture & data flow

The host federates `./routes`; the fe-gateway serves the remote bundle at
`/social/mastodon` **and** proxies every same-origin `/bff/**` call to the BFF
services, converting the browser's opaque `bff_` cookie to the internal
Casdoor-JWT bearer server-side (`BffCookieToBearerWebFilter`) before forwarding
— see [Auth, session & role-gate](#auth-session--role-gate). Since the **D6
BFF-proxy cutover** (now the default), `MastodonService` itself talks to
`user-bff-api`'s `MastodonProxyController` hsproxy (`/bff/user/mastodon/...`)
rather than to the Mastodon homeserver directly; the hsproxy owns the upstream
homeserver token server-side and forwards the native `/api/...` path verbatim:

    adminBff -->|"decide→apply chain, bearer-forwarded"| federationApi["federation-api<br/>(hasAnyRole('ADMIN','SUPERADMIN') + domain scope)"]
```

The browser only ever holds the **opaque `bff_` session cookie**; the
fe-gateway's pre-security exchange filter swaps it for the internal Casdoor
custody JWT before forwarding to whichever BFF owns the path, so each BFF is a
Casdoor-JWT resource server that enforces its own `hasRole`/`hasAnyRole` gate
(see [Auth, session & role-gate](#auth-session--role-gate)). The remote never
sees a raw Casdoor or per-service token.

## Routes / key components

All routes are children of `MASTODON_ROUTES`, mounted by the host at
`/social/mastodon/...`:

| Path | Component | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `''`, `home` | `MastodonTimelineComponent` | home timeline + top composer |
| `local` | `MastodonTimelineComponent` | `data.source: community` (local public) |
| `public` | `MastodonTimelineComponent` | federated public |
| `tags/:tag` | `MastodonTimelineComponent` | hashtag timeline |
| `favourites`, `bookmarks` | `MastodonTimelineComponent` | Link-header paginated |
| `lists/:id` | `MastodonTimelineComponent` | list timeline |
| `status/:id` | `StatusDetailComponent` | single status + ancestor/descendant context |
| `account/:acct` | `AccountProfileComponent` | profile + that account's statuses |
| `notifications` | `NotificationsColumnComponent` | |
| `search` | `SearchComponent` | accounts / statuses / hashtags |
| `explore` | `ExploreComponent` | trending statuses / tags / links |
| `direct` | `ConversationsColumnComponent` | DM conversations |
| `lists` | `ListsIndexComponent` | the caller's lists |

`MastodonTimelineComponent` is reused across the home, local, public, hashtag,
list, favourites, and bookmarks routes. The route's `data.source` field (plus the
`:tag` / `:id` path params) tells the component which timeline to fetch, so only
one component handles all seven views.

Key supporting components:

- `TootCardComponent` — renders a single status with reply / boost / favourite /
  bookmark actions, content-warning expand, media, and an embedded `PollComponent`.
- `ComposeBoxComponent` — the post composer, also used inline for replies.
- `RoleActionsMenuComponent` — the role-tiered moderation menu (see [Role-tiered action surface](#role-tiered-action-surface)).
- `AppearancePanelComponent` — per-user appearance settings (see [Appearance / style preferences](#appearance--style-preferences)).

Remote/federated HTML (toot content via `safeContent()`, profile bio + fields via
`safe()`) is rendered through Angular's `[innerHTML]` binding **with the built-in
sanitizer left on** — these helpers return the raw string and never call
`bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, so injected `<script>` / `on*` handlers / `javascript:`
URLs are stripped while safe formatting markup is kept (stored/DOM XSS, A03 /
CWE-79). ✅ shipped.

`MastodonService` (`src/app/mastodon.service.ts`) is a thin, typed wrapper over
the Mastodon REST API, covering timelines, statuses and context, post /
favourite / reblog / bookmark, polls, media, notifications, accounts and
relationships, search, favourites, bookmarks, lists, conversations, and trends.
The Mastodon instance base URL comes from the runtime global
`__HUG_MASTODON_URL__` (default `https://mastodon.hugmesh.net`); all
requests are proxied through the fe-gateway.

## Auth, session & role-gate

Login/registration happen entirely in the **login** remote's own native form,
which POSTs credentials to its own BFF's login endpoint; Casdoor
(`id.hugmesh.net`) is **internal-only** and never redirects the
browser — there is no OAuth2/OIDC authorization-code browser redirect anywhere
in this flow. **`hugmesh-user-bff-api`** authenticates the submitted
credentials against Casdoor server-side and holds the per-session Casdoor JWT
custody + refresh. The browser — and therefore this remote — only ever holds
an **opaque `bff_`-prefixed session**; the user never sees their own Casdoor
JWT, and there is no per-service Mastodon token in the browser. This remote
never renders a login form.

- `MastodonService` and the BFF services attach the shared opaque `bff_` session
  as a same-origin cookie (`withCredentials`/`credentials: 'include'`), never as
  an `Authorization` header; the fe-gateway's `BffCookieToBearerWebFilter` swaps
  `bff_` for the internal custody JWT server-side before forwarding to whichever
  BFF owns the path, so each BFF (`user-bff-api`, `mod-bff-api`,
  `admin-bff-api`) is a pure Casdoor-JWT resource server that enforces its own
  `hasRole`/`hasAnyRole` gate downstream.
- The host injects nothing service-specific; a host may still call
  `setAccessToken()` only as a standalone-dev no-op override (see
  `MastodonService.setAccessToken`).

> Auth-core extraction is complete: user-bff performs the native-login
> credential check against Casdoor server-side (no browser redirect) and holds
> the per-session Casdoor custody JWT + refresh. The account/session **data of
> record** lives in `admin-bff-db`;
> user-bff reaches it via `admin-bff` `/bff/internal` over mTLS +
> `X-Internal-Token`. The shared `hugmesh-auth-core` Maven artifact carries the
> common session/MFA/Casdoor-admin infrastructure. This remote only ever talks to
> the fe-gateway (which forwards to the BFF services) and is unaffected by where
> the BFF logic lives.

`SessionService` (`src/app/session.service.ts`) is the canonical HugMesh
session store. It holds the `HugSession` and derives the Casdoor role tiers as
signals — `isUser` (any authed user), `isMod` (`mod` **or** `admin`), `isAdmin`
(`admin` only) — plus `fullyRegistered`. Each remote and the host hold their own
`SessionService` over the same shared session and re-read on a same-document
broadcast / cross-tab `storage` event, so completing registration in the login
remote unlocks the host shell's social nav.

These role signals are **defence-in-depth**: the bff-apis enforce
`ROLE_USER`/`MOD`/`ADMIN` server-side (and the gateway runs the data-driven
`gateway_route_access` gate — ADMIN/GAME-MASTER bypass within own domain,
SUPERADMIN cross-domain), and the UI simply never shows an option the role can't
use. The additive tiers preserve the invariant that a MOD never sees the ADMIN
tier and a USER never sees the MOD/ADMIN tier.

### Role-tiered action surface

`RoleActionsMenuComponent` (element `hug-mastodon-role-actions`, mounted from
both `TootCardComponent` and `AccountProfileComponent`) is a single reusable
menu that renders additive tiers based on the session role signals:

| Tier | Signal | Actions | BFF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USER | `isUser` | self-block an account (`POST/DELETE /bff/user/blocks`); recommend instance block to mods (`POST /bff/user/recommend-instance-block`) | `UserBffService` |
| MOD | `isMod` | server-wide block of a user or instance (`POST /bff/mod/block`); triage moderation queue (`GET /bff/mod/moderation`); refer case to admin (`POST /bff/mod/moderation/{id}/refer`) | `ModBffService` |
| ADMIN | `isAdmin` | approve / deny a referred moderation request (`POST /bff/admin/moderation/{id}/decide?approve=<bool>`) — wired to `admin-bff-api`'s decide→apply chain, which bearer-forwards to `federation-api`'s own `hasAnyRole('ADMIN','SUPERADMIN')` + per-domain scope check; an approved `user-removal` auto-applies a kill-switch override, a denied re-decision rearms it. A failed decide surfaces an alert and is NEVER treated as applied. The full Mastodon admin console still lives in `hugmesh-admin-ui` by design — this menu only covers the decide step of the USER→MOD→ADMIN referral chain. | `AdminBffService` |

A MOD sees the USER tier plus the MOD tier. An ADMIN sees all three tiers,
including the wired decide action.

### SOCIAL local-only / domain-lock ✅ shipped

When an admin/mod domain-locks an account, the homeserver's **force-local MRF is
the actual enforcer** — the UI is honest defence-in-depth on top of it, never the
source of truth.

`SessionService.mastodonDomainLocked` is a computed signal off a
`MASTODON_DOMAINLOCKED` role marker that the BFF tier forwards (domainlock
pass-through; the account/domainlock data of record lives in `admin-bff-db`,
surfaced into the session via the user-bff/gateway path). The marker is
normalised before it is read: a `ROLE_MASTODON_DOMAINLOCKED` / mixed-case variant
is lowercased to `mastodon_domainlocked` (the same reserved-prefix-aware folding
the rest of the session roles use), so the lock survives prefix/case differences
across BFFs.

In `ComposeBoxComponent`, a domain-locked user (`domainLocked()` true):

- has the **federated-reach visibilities** (`public`, `unlisted`) disabled +
  helptext'd in the visibility picker, with the local-only indicator shown as
  enforced (`aria-disabled` so it stays focusable, not natively `disabled`);
- has the bound visibility **coerced down to `private`** in `ngDoCheck` if it is
  ever a federated value (e.g. a `defaultVisibility` Input, or a cross-tab lock
  that lands after the composer opened), and **again at `submit()`** as a second
  defence-in-depth layer even if the bound value was somehow set past the
  disabled UI.

The non-locked case is left honest too: a per-post local-only toggle is *not*
wired (no per-post local-only flag on the homeserver yet), so the control shows
"not available yet" copy rather than pretending to work.

## BFFs & multi-tenancy

The remote talks to three same-origin BFF APIs that the fe-gateway proxies. The
base URL defaults to the same origin and can be overridden via
`__HUG_BFF_URL__`:

- `UserBffService` → `/bff/user/**` (hugmesh-user-bff-api, `hasRole('USER')`):
  self-blocks and instance-block recommendations. The user-bff-api pins `owner`
  to the JWT subject on every query, so a user can only read or modify their own
  rows — no server-side enforcement is needed in the UI. The same service also
  hosts the `mastodon` hsproxy (`MastodonService`'s default transport) and the
  AI-cloak media proxy.
- `ModBffService` → `/bff/mod/**` (hugmesh-mod-bff-api): the moderation queue
  and server-wide blocks, gated server-side by `hasAnyRole('MOD','ADMIN')`.
- `AdminBffService` → `/bff/admin/**` (hugmesh-admin-bff-api,
  `hasRole('ADMIN')`): approve/deny a referred moderation request. Bearer-
  forwards the caller's identity to `federation-api`'s own
  `hasAnyRole('ADMIN','SUPERADMIN')` + domain-scope check, so this remote never
  authorises a decision on its own, only relays it.

All three follow the HugMesh datastore pattern (RxJS `BehaviorSubject`-backed,
single source of truth where there's a cached collection) and attach the shared
opaque `bff_` session as a cookie (`withCredentials`/`credentials: 'include'`);
the fe-gateway derives the bearer server-side, so the browser never holds one.
Because the gateway resolves the BFF target per request and the BFFs key every
row to the authenticated JWT subject (issuer-keyed domain scoping), the same
federated bundle serves every brand/tenant — the remote carries no per-tenant
config.

### AI-cloak media (poison-before-ingest)

When the composer uploads an **image** with the per-user AI-cloak preference ON,
it routes the file through the BFF media proxy
(`POST /bff/user/media/upload`, authed with the `bff_` session) so the bytes are
Glaze/Nightshade-style perturbed **before** the homeserver ingests / re-encodes /
federates them — a direct `/api/v2/media` upload would let the clean original
federate first. The BFF returns the homeserver `MediaAttachment` exactly as a
direct upload would (downstream `submit()` / `media_ids` is untouched) plus a
server-owned `cloak` decision.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as ComposeBoxComponent
    participant BFF as user-bff-api
    participant W as Cloak worker
    participant M as Mastodon homeserver

    C->>BFF: GET /bff/user/media/capability
    BFF-->>C: { available: true/false }
    C->>C: render shield badge (pending)

    C->>BFF: POST /bff/user/media/upload (image bytes, bff_ cookie)
    BFF->>W: enqueue perturbation job
    BFF-->>C: { ref, status: "pending" }

    loop poll until settled
        C->>BFF: GET /bff/user/media/status/{ref}
        BFF-->>C: { status: "pending" | "protected" | "degraded" | "failed" }
    end

    W->>M: POST /api/v2/media (perturbed bytes)
    M-->>W: MediaAttachment
    W-->>BFF: MediaAttachment + cloak decision
    BFF-->>C: MediaAttachment (same shape as direct upload)

    C->>C: badge flips → protected / degraded
    C->>M: POST /api/v1/statuses (media_ids=[...])
```

The composer checks `GET /bff/user/media/capability` when it opens so the shield
state is shown immediately, before any file is chosen. The per-attachment badge
polls `GET /bff/user/media/status/{ref}` and flips from `pending` to
`protected` or `degraded` as the worker completes.

The UI copy is deliberately honest: it never displays "protected" for a
`degraded` / `skipped` / `unavailable` / `failed` outcome. When the heavy worker
tier is absent (for example on a Pi5-only cluster without the x86 cloaking
node), a warning appears before the user posts so they can choose to continue
without protection.

## Appearance / style preferences

Every signed-in user (user / mod / admin) can customise **their own** look
through the timeline-header gear icon (`AppearancePanelComponent`). Available
options, modelled on the spirit of TangerineUI for Mastodon with no CSS
copied: colour theme and accent, light / dark / auto mode, single vs multi
column, density, media corner style, font family (including a dyslexia-friendly
option), text size, high-contrast mode, and reduced-motion toggle.

`PreferencesService` is the single source of truth for these settings. Every
change flows through a single `set()` → `persist()`/`pushUserPref()` chokepoint:
it applies **immediately and locally** (never blocked on the network) — saved
to a versioned localStorage key (`hug.mastodon.prefs.v1`) and applied as
`data-*` attributes and CSS custom properties **scoped to this remote's own
root** (`.hug-mastodon` / `hug-mastodon-root`, preventing leakage onto the
host shell or sibling remotes) — and is also synced **durably** to the caller's
account via `PUT /bff/user/preferences` in the background; a failed durable
write is never a silent no-op, it surfaces on `PreferencesService.syncError()`
so the panel can tell the user the change may not follow them to another
device. On load, the resolved order is: built-in default ← the org/admin
default (`GET /bff/mastodon/appearance-default`, falling back to the shipped
`assets/mastodon-appearance-default.json` asset only when no admin-bff default
is configured yet or the fetch fails) ← the caller's own saved prefs
(`GET /bff/user/preferences`, server value wins over the localStorage cache).
The OS `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-contrast` media queries are read
on first load and used as defaults before the user sets their own preference.

An ADMIN-only control ("set as the default for everyone",
`PreferencesService.setOrgDefault()`) applies + caches the new default locally
immediately (so the admin sees it take effect right away and it survives an
offline reload) and pushes it durably via
`PUT /bff/admin/mastodon/appearance-default` (`admin-bff-api`,
`hasRole('ADMIN')` server-side) in the background; the same honest
`syncError()` surfacing applies if that write fails. The chat-theme group is
stripped out of the org default at this chokepoint — chat styling is
personal-only by design (see [Chat theming](#chat-theming)) and can never
become the org default.

## Voice & video messages, VN chat mode & chat theming

### Voice & video messages

`ComposeBoxComponent` can record a voice (mic) or video (camera + mic, capped
at 720p) message in place, via `MediaRecorderService`
(`src/app/media-recorder.service.ts`) — a `getUserMedia` + `MediaRecorder`
wrapper that is **component-provided on purpose**: every composer (including
each inline DM reply composer) owns its own instance, so one composer's
recording never bleeds into another and Angular tears the mic/camera down with
the component. A recording is hard-capped at five minutes: at 300 s the take is
**finalised** exactly as if the user pressed Stop, never silently discarded.
The finished take previews locally (an object URL, revoked on
attach/discard/destroy), and Attach feeds the recorded `File` through the
**same** ingest path a picked file uses — `MastodonService.uploadMedia`
(`POST /api/v2/media`); the AI-cloak route is image-only and never sees it.
Playback on the receiving side needed no new code: `TootCardComponent` already
renders `<audio>` / `<video>` attachments. Fail-soft throughout: a browser
without `MediaRecorder`/`getUserMedia` hides the record buttons entirely
(never a dead control), and permission refusal / device failure surfaces as an
honest status line while the composer stays fully usable.

### VN chat mode

Each conversation on the `direct` route can be swapped **in place** into a
visual-novel presentation and back, via its per-conversation "VN mode" toggle
(`ConversationsColumnComponent` → `hug-mastodon-vn-chat`, `src/app/vn/`): a
flat-vector scene background + on-stage prop layer, participant "sprites"
(framed avatars with name plates; the current message's sender lit, the others
dimmed), and a classic dialogue box that walks the thread one message at a
time (Prev / Next / Latest, opening on the newest). The thread is fetched the
way the app already can — the conversation's `last_status` plus
`GET /api/v1/statuses/{id}/context` — and replying uses the same
direct-visibility `hug-mastodon-compose-box` (voice/video messages included).
Scenes and props are **shipped local assets only** (`SceneService` over the
schema-versioned `assets/vn/scenes/scenes.json` manifest — no federated bytes
ever reach the stage), and message bodies pass through the exact DOMPurify +
Angular-sanitizer gate `toot-card` uses, so VN mode widens no federated-HTML
surface. The typewriter text reveal is skipped under reduced motion. The
embedded scene/prop picker persists per user through `PreferencesService`
(keys below).

### Chat theming

The appearance panel gains a **Chat** section — personal-only by design:
`setOrgDefault` strips the whole group, so a user's (or admin's) chat styling
can never become the org default. Options: bubble shape, your/their bubble
accent colours (strict `#rrggbb`, validated before a value can ever reach a
CSS-var write), chat font, chat density, background pattern, and the VN
dialogue-box skin — plus a live bubble preview and a chat-only reset. Every
choice flows through the same `PreferencesService` chokepoint as the rest of
the appearance group: applied as `data-mastodon-chat-*` attributes +
`--mastodon-chat-*` CSS custom properties scoped to this remote's root,
persisted to `hug.mastodon.prefs.v1`, and synced best-effort via
`GET`/`PUT /bff/user/preferences` under the durable keys:

| Field | Durable key | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chatBubbleShape` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.bubbleShape` | `rounded` (default) / `square` / `sharp` |
| `chatAccentMine` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.accentMine` | `#rrggbb`, or `''` = unset (default) |
| `chatAccentTheirs` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.accentTheirs` | `#rrggbb`, or `''` = unset (default) |
| `chatFont` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.font` | `system` (default) / `serif` / `rounded` / `mono` |
| `chatDensity` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.density` | `cozy` (default) / `compact` |
| `chatBackground` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.background` | `none` (default) / `dots` / `lined` / `stars` |
| `vnDialogSkin` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.vnDialogSkin` | `classic` (default) / `glass` / `retro` |
| `chatVnScene` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.vnScene` | a scene id from `assets/vn/scenes/scenes.json` (default `vn_scene_bedroom`) |
| `chatVnProps` | `mastodon.appearance.chat.vnProps` | comma-joined prop ids, `''` = none (default) |

The `.vn-dialog` class (with `.chat-surface`, `.chat-bubble`,
`.chat-bubble--mine`, `.chat-bubble--theirs`) is the **only** selector contract
between the VN view / chat surfaces and the preference SCSS in
`src/styles.scss`. High-contrast mode always beats the decorative skins and
accents, and with the built-in defaults the rendered look is exactly the
pre-theming one. E2E coverage (Gherkin plus real step-definitions) exists under the `@cluster`
tag (`e2e/features/social/voice-video-messages.feature`,
`e2e/features/social/vn-chat-mode.feature`); a no-filter `bddgen` passes for
both, but they remain `@cluster`-gated pending verification against a live
stack.

## Accessibility conventions

This remote follows the cross-repo HugMesh a11y standard. The baseline rules
are included in `src/styles.scss`, making the remote accessible both when run
standalone and when federated into the host:

- The `.sr` screen-reader-only helper carries text labels alongside icon-only
  controls; decorative emoji/icons are `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Async results announce through live regions — `role="status"`/`aria-live`
  (`polite`) for normal updates, `role="alert"`/`assertive` for errors; the
  appearance panel and role-actions menu announce each applied change.
- Toggle controls expose state via `aria-pressed` / `aria-expanded`; pop-over
  panels trap focus on open, restore it to the trigger on close, and close on
  `Escape`.
- Composer fields use unique `<label for>` bindings (per-instance id prefixes so
  inline reply composers stay unique) and a live character counter.
- WCAG-AA/AAA `--hug-*` colour tokens, a touch-target minimum, and a
  reduced-motion media query are baked into the baseline styles.
- Full **keyboard operability** ✅ shipped: native buttons/inputs/selects
  throughout; the account-profile tabs are a WAI-ARIA `tablist` with a roving
  `tabindex` driven by `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` / `Home` / `End`
  (`onTabKeydown`); the compose "Attach media" file input is visually hidden but
  kept **in the tab order** (`.sr`, not `hidden`) so it stays focusable; and the
  dev shell provides a skip link to a focusable `<main>` landmark, backed by a
  global `:focus-visible` ring.

## Known Gaps / TODO

These are the unfinished or intentionally-stubbed pieces of this remote,
verified against the current code (not aspirational):

- **Server-wide block's external homeserver-admin call is STUBBED server-side** —
  `ModBffService.block()` (`POST /bff/mod/block`) always writes the local audit
  row, but the `external` field in the response can come back `'stubbed'`
  rather than `'ok'`; the UI surfaces whatever the BFF reports honestly rather
  than assuming success (`src/app/mod-bff.service.ts:17-22`, `101-106`).
- **User self-block's external push can also be `'stubbed'` or `'n/a'`** —
  `UserBffService`'s `BlockAck.external` is a free-form status string
  (`'live' | 'stubbed' | 'n/a'`), not always `'live'`
  (`src/app/user-bff.service.ts:27-31`).
- **Appearance/preference syncs (both the caller's own prefs and the ADMIN
  org-default) are best-effort/non-blocking, not transactional** — `set()` and
  `setOrgDefault()` apply + cache locally IMMEDIATELY, then push durably to
  `PUT /bff/user/preferences` / `PUT /bff/admin/mastodon/appearance-default` in
  the background (`src/app/preferences.service.ts` `pushUserPref`/
  `pushOrgDefault`, `552-595`); a failed durable write is never a silent
  no-op — it surfaces on `PreferencesService.syncError()` — but it also never
  blocks or retries automatically, so a value can still drift per-browser/
  per-device until the next successful write.
- **No live notification auto-refresh** — `NotificationsColumnComponent` loads
  once on mount (`ngOnInit` → `reload()`) and otherwise only re-fetches on an
  explicit filter switch, "load more", dismiss, or clear-all; there is no
  interval/timer/SSE subscription that brings in new Mastodon-native
  notifications (mentions/boosts/favourites/follows) while the column stays
  open (`src/app/notifications-column.component.ts`). This is a **different**
  gap from the platform SSE toast (see Roadmap) — that stream never carries
  Mastodon-native notification types.
- **Per-post local-only posting is honestly unavailable for non-domain-locked
  accounts** — `ComposeBoxComponent`'s local-only toggle stays `aria-disabled`
  outside the domain-locked (forced) case: the standard Mastodon visibility enum
  has no per-post local-only flag and no BFF endpoint accepts one, so the control
  discloses "not available yet" rather than acting
  (`src/app/compose-box.component.html:226-270`).

## Current State

- **Stack:** Angular 22 + `@angular-architects/native-federation` 22; native-
  federation **remote** `mastodon` exposing `./routes` → `MASTODON_ROUTES`,
  federated by the host shell at `/social/mastodon`. Requires Node `^22.22.3 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0` (Angular CLI 22 engine constraint).
- **Optional service:** this remote is the UI for the **akkoma/Mastodon** optional
  service. It degrades gracefully (greyed-out / honest "not available" copy) when
  the homeserver, the worker tier, or a backing BFF endpoint is absent.
- **Auth:** native-login via the login remote's own form (POSTs credentials to
  its BFF; Casdoor is internal-only and never redirects the browser); user-bff
  does the server-side credential check and holds the per-session Casdoor JWT.
  The browser holds only the **opaque `bff_` session cookie**; the fe-gateway
  runs the `bff_`→custody-JWT exchange filter (`BffCookieToBearerWebFilter`)
  before forwarding to whichever BFF owns the path, so each BFF
  (`user-bff-api`/`mod-bff-api`/`admin-bff-api`) is itself a pure Casdoor-JWT
  resource server enforcing its own role gate. The remote renders no login form.
- **Shipped:** native-federation remote + UI standard adoption; full route surface
  over a typed `MastodonService` (routed through the user-bff-api hsproxy by
  default); sanitizer-on XSS hardening (no `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`);
  USER/MOD/ADMIN role-tiered action surface incl. the ADMIN approve/deny decide
  wired to `admin-bff-api`; SOCIAL local-only / domain-lock coerce-to-private in
  the composer; AI-cloak poison-before-ingest media proxy; per-user
  appearance/style preferences durably synced via `/bff/user/preferences` +
  an ADMIN org-default synced via `/bff/admin/mastodon/appearance-default`
  (both real admin-bff-api endpoints, with a localStorage cache + a shipped
  asset as the offline/unconfigured fallback); cross-repo a11y baseline + full
  keyboard operability; voice/video DM messages, a per-conversation VN chat
  mode, and chat appearance theming; baseline nginx HTTP security headers incl.
  a strict per-response nonce-based CSP with no `script-src unsafe-inline`
  (see "Deploy" below); Playwright +
  BDD/Gherkin e2e harness (ships dark); GitLab CI build+push + OWASP pentest
  stage (SCA + authenticated ZAP/nuclei baseline).
  `NotificationsColumnComponent` loads on mount and on filter-switch /
  load-more / dismiss / clear-all — there is **no** automatic re-fetch
  interval today (see [Known Gaps](#known-gaps--todo)).
- **CI/CD:** **GitLab only** (no GitHub Actions — the GitHub repo is pull-mirrored
  into in-cluster GitLab). `.gitlab-ci.yml` builds + pushes the nginx image to the
  in-cluster registry and `include`s the centralized generator pentest templates;
  deployed to `hugmesh-frontend` and fronted by the fe-gateway. ArgoCD GitOps.

## Roadmap

UI-touching items from the platform roadmap that land in this remote when the
backing work ships (this remote stays a thin BFF/gateway client — most of these
are gated on a new BFF endpoint or homeserver capability, not on this repo):

- **SSO end-to-end live + e2e:** flip the e2e harness green against a live
  Casdoor→user-bff→gateway path once the opaque-`bff_` session is wired through
  the gateway for the social routes.
- **MFA (WebAuthn + TOTP + recovery):** surface step-up challenges where a
  privileged Mastodon action requires it; per-role defaults are enforced upstream
  (login remote / user-bff), not here.
- ✅ **Durable preferences + org default — SHIPPED.** Appearance prefs sync to
  `/bff/user/preferences` and the ADMIN org-default syncs to
  `/bff/admin/mastodon/appearance-default` (both real `admin-bff-api`
  endpoints); the versioned localStorage key is now an apply-immediately cache
  + offline fallback layered underneath, not the sole store. See
  [Appearance / style preferences](#appearance--style-preferences).
- ✅ **ADMIN moderation approve/deny — SHIPPED.** The ADMIN tier's decide
  action is wired to `admin-bff-api`'s `POST /bff/admin/moderation/{id}/decide`
  (`AdminBffService`), which bearer-forwards to `federation-api`'s decide→apply
  chain. The full Mastodon admin console still stays in `admin-ui` by design —
  this remote only covers the decide step. See
  [Role-tiered action surface](#role-tiered-action-surface).
- **Notification auto-refresh:** `NotificationsColumnComponent` has no
  interval/timer/SSE subscription today — it only re-fetches on an explicit
  user action (see [Known Gaps](#known-gaps--todo)). Mastodon/Akkoma's own
  native WebSocket streaming API (`/api/v1/streaming`) would be the natural
  real-time source; a plain polling interval is the simpler fallback.
- **Per-post local-only toggle:** wire the non-locked composer toggle once the
  homeserver advertises a per-post local-only flag.
- **A/V is LAN-only today:** no TURN/SFU yet; federated audio/video reach is
  blocked on the platform coturn/TURN work.
- ✅ **SSE real-time PLATFORM notifications — already covered by the host shell
  (no code needed in this remote).** `GET /bff/user/notifications/events`
  (user-bff-api `main`, PR #72) and the host-shell `NotificationToastService`
  toast (`hugmesh.net` `main`, PR #104) are both merged. Because this
  remote is a **routed, chrome-less native-federation remote** mounted inside
  `hugmesh.net`' persistent `AppComponent` (`RouterOutlet` +
  `NotificationToastComponent` live at the host's app-root, wrapping every
  route including `/social/mastodon/**`), the host's toast already fires while
  browsing this remote — there is no separate chrome here to host a second
  toast overlay in, and adding one would double-fire every event. **No action
  needed in this repo.**

  Note this is a DIFFERENT notification domain than
  `NotificationsColumnComponent` below: the platform SSE stream carries the
  four `user_notifications` categories (`account-restriction`, `role-change`,
  `infra-impacting`, `feature-availability`) — never Mastodon-native
  mentions/boosts/favourites/follows, which stay on `NotificationsColumnComponent`'s
  own homeserver-backed on-demand feed (load-on-mount + explicit refresh, no
  auto-refresh interval today — see Known Gaps). Mastodon/Akkoma's
  own native WebSocket streaming API (`/api/v1/streaming`) — a real-time push
  for the *social* notification feed itself — remains a SEPARATE, unstarted
  🔭 planned item, distinct from the platform SSE stream this bullet is about.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm start                 # ng serve mastodon — the dev shell on :4202
npm run build             # build the remote → dist/mastodon/browser
npm run build:mastodon    # same (explicit alias)
npm test                  # ng test mastodon (ChromeHeadlessCI, single run)
```

The application builder nests output under `dist/mastodon/browser/`, including
`remoteEntry.json` (the federation manifest that exposes `./routes`). Angular CLI
22 requires Node `^22.22.3 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0` (from the `@angular/cli` engines field).

## Deploy

`Dockerfile` builds the remote and serves `dist/mastodon/browser` via nginx
**with CORS** (the host fetches `remoteEntry.json` cross-origin) and a baseline
set of **HTTP security headers** (see below); `/healthz` returns `200`.
`.gitlab-ci.yml` builds + pushes the image to the in-cluster GitLab registry (the
GitHub repo is pull-mirrored into in-cluster GitLab). The image is deployed to
the `hugmesh-frontend` namespace and fronted by the fe-gateway at
`/social/mastodon`.

### nginx security headers ✅ shipped

`nginx.conf` emits defence-in-depth HTTP security headers on every response
(`always`, so error responses are covered too), tuned to be inspection-safe for
an Angular SPA + module-federation remotes + OAuth redirect flows:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — stop MIME-type sniffing.
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — clickjacking protection (the SPA is never framed;
  module federation loads remotes via `<script>`, not iframes).
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` — don't leak full URLs
  cross-origin.
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` — pin HTTPS
  for a year incl. subdomains (only affects HTTPS responses).
- `Content-Security-Policy` on the SPA `location /` — a **strong, nonce-based**
  XSS backstop, carrying **no `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-hashes` in `script-src`**:
  `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-$cspnonce' blob:; style-src
  'self' 'unsafe-inline' blob:; img-src 'self' data: blob: https:; font-src
  'self' data:; connect-src 'self' blob: https: wss:; worker-src 'self' blob:;
  base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`. A fresh,
  unpredictable per-request nonce (derived from nginx's `$request_id`) is
  stamped into both the header and every inline `<script>` tag of `index.html`
  via `sub_filter`; `es-module-shims` propagates that nonce to the module
  scripts it injects, so the whole bootstrap chain stays nonce-clean. This is
  on top of, not instead of, the sanitizer-on rendering. Because nginx
  `add_header` does **not** merge across blocks, the server-scope headers are
  repeated in each `location` (`/`, `/healthz`) that sets its own header, so
  they keep covering those responses.

Stricter policies (COEP/CORP, `Permissions-Policy`) are deliberately deferred —
they need per-UI tuning + browser validation in the live-cluster pass.

### OWASP pen-test stage ✅ shipped

`.gitlab-ci.yml` declares three stages — `e2e`, `build`, and `pentest` — and
`include`s the centralized OWASP pen-test templates from the generator
(`hugmesh/hugmesh-generator @ main`,
`/tests/pentest/ci/pentest-stage.gitlab-ci.yml`), so this repo rides the one
source of truth rather than carrying its own scanner config:

- `pentest:sca` extends `.pentest-sca` — Dependency-Check SCA over this repo's
  checkout.
- `pentest:dast` extends `.pentest-dast-baseline` — an authenticated ZAP baseline
  (spider + passive + probes + nuclei) via the shared harness against a spun-up
  env-test-build.

Both run on merge requests and the default branch and are `allow_failure: true`,
so a finding reports without breaking the image build. `make pentest`
(`pentest-sca` + `pentest-dast`) runs the same self-scan locally, mirroring the CI
stage (SCA via `npm audit` locally / Dependency-Check in CI; DAST via the shared
harness when `DAST_TARGET_URL` is set).
