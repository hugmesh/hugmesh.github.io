Gherkin-driven end-to-end harness for the admin-ui federated remote, copied from
the proven `hugmesh-games/e2e` pattern (`@playwright/test` +
`playwright-bdd`, single-worker serial, `screenshot:'on'`/`video:'on'`, HTML
reporter, the per-step PNG `AfterStep` hook in
`features/support/fixtures.ts`).

The admin-ui is the **multi-tenant authorization keystone**, so this suite leads
with the deepest cross-user / DENY coverage:

| Class | Feature file | What it asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USER-SITUATIONAL | `features/admin/admin-surfaces.feature` | each admin / superadmin console, guard ALLOW + DENY |
| USER-SITUATIONAL | `features/admin/games-services-gating.feature` | runner sees the console but create is **disabled + `gs-runner-help`** helptext; admin's create is enabled |
| USER-SITUATIONAL | `features/admin/route-matrix.feature` | table-driven per-role route matrix: every `admin.routes.ts` route × {superadmin, admin, **mod**, plain user, **signed-out**}, outcomes derived from the actual guards |
| MUTATION | `features/admin/mutations.feature` | REAL writes: superadmin creates+updates an announcement via the UI; games-admin creates an instance; runner / cross-domain admin POSTs → 403; victim-creates-first cross-tenant PUT/DELETE → 404 (invisible-by-design) with the victim's row untouched |
| MULTIUSER | `features/multitenant/domain-admin.feature` | a domain admin operating over their **own** domain |
| CROSS-USER | `features/multitenant/cross-domain-isolation.feature` | domain-A admin DENIED on domain-B; admin DENIED on superadmin-only; anonymous → 401; superadmin reads BOTH brands where each admin sees only its own (the DomainScope null predicate) |
| SECURITY | `features/security/bff-auth-gates.feature` | the admin-bff rejection paths behind the display-only consoles, incl. the mod sibling-not-superset 403s and a REAL runner create-POST → 403 |
| A11Y | `features/a11y/accessibility.feature` | skip-link → focus `#main`, named landmarks, roving tabindex, capability-gate `role="status"`, focus restore |
| EVERY-FUNCTION | `features/admin/route-access-edit.feature` | Gateway-access rule editor: `@offline` client-side blank-pattern validation (role=alert + `aria-invalid`, no write); `@cluster` real add+remove (row rendered from the server response, `data-rule-id`) and a mod add-POST → 403 |
| EVERY-FUNCTION | `features/admin/node-storage.feature` | Node-storage console: `@offline` the node-pinned **no-HA warning** heuristic on a database-shaped service name, and attach-form blank-submit validation; `@cluster` a mod attach-POST → 403 |
| EVERY-FUNCTION | `features/admin/read-only-consoles.feature` | `@offline` honest no-backend states of the read-only / infra-gated consoles: Usage default figures, ISO empty state, ArgoCD + Backup **capability-gate degradation** (action surface suppressed), Recovery empty state |
| EVERY-FUNCTION | `features/admin/device-pending.feature` | Pending-devices pick-list: `@offline` register control **disabled** with no candidate + opaque-fp placeholder (superadmin); `@cluster` a domain-admin register-POST → 403 (superadmin-only) |
| MUTATION | `features/admin/egress-vpn-cross-domain.feature` | Egress-VPN console: superadmin imports a VPN config into a brand that is **not its own** (real cross-domain write, UI evidence) and a domain admin's identical POST → 403 (SUPERADMIN-only, not "any admin") |
| MUTATION | `features/admin/account-appeals-decide.feature` | Account-ban Appeals console (admin-ui #65): ADMIN approve **actually restores** the appellant's access (re-read via the BFF, not assumed from the 200), ADMIN deny leaves it restricted, SUPERADMIN decides **cross-domain**, and a mod's decide attempt is a real 403 (not merely UI-hidden) |
| USER-SITUATIONAL | `features/admin/phone-fleet.feature` | Superadmin Phone-fleet console (sovereign MDM registry): guard ALLOW/DENY, menu visibility, BFF role gate, list-read honesty — no write seam here (enrolment/profile management is device-side) |
| MUTATION | `features/admin/phone-management.feature` | Extends phone-fleet with the WRITE seam: superadmin sets the authoritative management mode (managed/BYOD) and locks/unlocks a managed device, SUPERADMIN-only + step-up gated |
| MULTIUSER | `features/admin/my-fleet.feature` | Fleet-owner "My fleet" console — a non-superadmin FLEET_ADMIN/ADMIN reaches ONLY their own phones (`fleetAdminGuard` ALLOW/DENY), the tenancy-walled twin of the superadmin console |
| MUTATION | `features/admin/fleet-provisioning.feature` | SUPERADMIN-only: owner assignment (the tenancy wall for My fleet) on the phone-fleet console, and the Fleet-entitlements grant/revoke console — both step-up gated |
| MULTIUSER | `features/admin/domain-capabilities.feature` | the three-actor CAPABILITY GATE: superadmin **grants** a domain, that domain's admin **enables** it, a domain-B admin's enable of domain-A → 403, no admin may grant (superadmin-only) → 403, and the platform-wide kill switch; `@offline` the ungranted admin's disabled toggle + hint |
| MULTIUSER | `features/admin/workload-hidden-tier.feature` | the HIDDEN menu tier's causal loop: a superadmin **grant** reveals the workload menu item + route to one admin mid-session; a **revoke** bounces the route back to `/admin` and the item disappears |
| MULTIUSER | `features/admin/mfa-security.feature` | cross-user MFA factor **isolation** (one admin's enrolled factor invisible to another), the honest **dark** state, and the step-up-gated remove + regenerate **journey** through the shared dialog with a real RFC-6238 code |
| MULTIUSER | `features/admin/role-revoke-mid-session.feature` | a **live** ROLE_ADMIN session works, a superadmin revokes it, and the SAME session's next admin read is cut off (revoked custody JWT); re-grant restores the seed |
| MUTATION | `features/admin/concurrent-admin-edits.feature` | two **same-domain** admins on one announcement: a save onto a rival-deleted row is refused (404, not a silent recreate); rival retitles converge on the last write for both |
| MUTATION | `features/admin/ssh-key-issuance.feature` | SSH credential mint: the ships-**dark** panel state, a domain admin's issue POST → 403 (superadmin-only), and the enabled-feature mint → step-up → **one-time** download journey |
| EVERY-FUNCTION | `features/admin/device-radios.feature` | `@offline` the per-transport form shape (serial/tcp/mqtt fields) + blank-attach validation; `@cluster` a mod attach POST → 403 |

## Two lanes: `@offline` (default, runs on `ng serve`) and `@cluster` (dark)

The wave-2b-1 suite ships everything that needs a live stack dark; the
every-function wave adds a second, **default-running** lane for pure client-side
UI behaviour that needs no backend.

- **`@offline`** — client-side behaviour reachable with **no backend**: form
  validation, a client-side heuristic warning, empty/degraded states, a disabled
  control. These carry **no `@cluster` tag**, so the default config
  (`tags: 'not @cluster'`) INCLUDES them — `npx bddgen` now generates the offline
  lane (currently **11 scenarios**). They run against the standalone dev shell
  (`ng serve admin`, which mounts `ADMIN_ROUTES` at the root — see
  `src/app/app.routes.ts`) with `E2E_BASE_URL` pointed at it. Every assertion is a
  real observable state change that fails against a blank page — never a bare
  "element exists".
- **`@cluster`** — needs the host shell serving the remote + admin-bff + Casdoor
  seed (real writes, the role/cross-domain DENY POSTs). Still filtered out by
  default; see "Running against a live stack" below.

### Offline UI lane (no cluster, no mocks)

```sh
# 1. serve the standalone admin remote (from the repo root)
npm install && npm start          # ng serve admin → prints http://localhost:<port>

# 2. run only the @offline lane against it (from e2e/)
cd e2e && npm install
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:<port> npx bddgen
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:<port> npx playwright test --grep-invert @cluster
```

No backend is started: the components render their default / empty / degraded
states (their BFF fetches simply reject and the templates render their fallbacks,
or the fail-safe absent capability envelope drives the capability-gate).

## Ships dark (wave 2b-1)

Every scenario that needs a live stack (host shell serving the remote +
admin-bff + Casdoor seed) is tagged **`@cluster`** at the feature level (or at
the scenario level in the every-function features, which mix an `@offline` and a
`@cluster` scenario in one file). The default config filters those out
(`tags: 'not @cluster'`); the GitLab `e2e:bdd` job is `allow_failure: true` and
only *compiles + lists* (it never launches a browser), so it stays green whether
the default lane is empty or holds the `@offline` scenarios.

`@cluster` is used deliberately instead of playwright-bdd's reserved `@skip`:
`@skip` drops a scenario from generation entirely (`bddgen` emits 0 specs for
it), so a `@skip`-tagged suite cannot be *discovered*. `@cluster` is a plain
filter tag — the no-filter validation below generates and lists every scenario
(**149 today across 32 files**), proving the Gherkin compiles, while the default
config keeps the `@cluster` ones dark and surfaces the `@offline` lane.

## Structural validation (no cluster, no browser)

```sh
npm install
npx bddgen            # default: 'not @cluster' → the 11 @offline specs (run them via
                      # the Offline UI lane above; @cluster scenarios stay dark)

# Prove every feature compiles + all scenarios are discovered (no filter). The
# no-filter config is committed as pw-validate.config.ts (it drops the `not @cluster`
# tag filter the default config carries), so validation is just:
npx bddgen -c pw-validate.config.ts
npx playwright test --list -c pw-validate.config.ts   # → 149 tests in 32 files
```

## Running against a live stack (later wave)

Drop the `@cluster` tag from a feature (or run with an override config that
omits the `not @cluster` filter), export `E2E_BASE_URL` + the per-role
`E2E_*_PASSWORD` vars, then `npm run bdd`.
