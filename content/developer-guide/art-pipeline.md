The `srd-taxonomy-v1` v2 pack is **assembled, not hand-edited**: the fragment JSONs in
this directory are the source of truth, and `pack.json` is generated from them.

- `*.json` (except `pack`-side files) — per-artist fragment manifests: one file per art
  lane, each declaring `{slot, part}` entries (and, for the faces lane, the
  `expressions`/`expressionSlots` index).
- `assemble.py` — merges fragments into the pack's `pack.json`: slot table, alias-fold
  (palette variants folded into base-entry tags to respect the 100-parts/slot cap),
  WotC-exclusion screen, legacy-id preservation, fragment↔SVG tint-class cross-check,
  and the **full-catalog species-coverage check** (every species in
  `docs/CATALOG-DND-SRD.md` must be an entry or a tag). Run:
  `python3 assemble.py` (dry-run) / `python3 assemble.py --write`.
- `compose_proof.py` — composes fragment parts into flattened proof SVG/PNG sheets
  (`python3 compose_proof.py OUTDIR head_dragon_01 body_x:head_y:acc_z ...`); needs
  `rsvg-convert` + PIL. This is the render-and-LOOK loop every art agent ran.
- `AGENT-BRIEF.md` / `QA-CHECKLIST.md` — the working brief and the accumulated visual-QA
  findings from the 2026-07 art pass (historical; session paths inside are stale, the
  rules are not).

Paths resolve relative to this directory (override with `CHIBI_WT` / `CHIBI_PACK`).
The binding style rules live in `docs/ART-STYLE-CHIBI.md`.
