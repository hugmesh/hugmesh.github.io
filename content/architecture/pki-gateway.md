Per-node-type instance of the HugMesh Spring Cloud Gateway — the **identity
tier** front door. It fronts Casdoor (auth / login / OIDC) and headscale (the
VPN/tailnet control plane). Internal-only (ingress class `nginx-internal`),
never internet-facing, and it validates the internal Casdoor JWT — no external
login is exposed.

It is **the same image and code as
[hugmesh-gateway](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-gateway)**.
Like its [be-](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-be-gateway) and
[fe-gateway](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-fe-gateway)
siblings this repo is a **thin overlay**: only the `SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME`, the
Postgres-backed route set (Liquibase), and the downstream URIs differ. The image
builds `FROM` the shared gateway image so every device runs identical, audited
gateway code — the same security filter chain, RBAC, domain-scoping converter,
and Cassandra-cached revocation / route-access / URL registry.

```bash
# bases off the sibling hugmesh-gateway image (GATEWAY_IMAGE build-arg)
docker build -t hugmesh-systems/pki-gateway:dev .
```

## Tier & namespace

| | |
|---|---|
| **Tier** | identity / PKI |
| **Namespace** | `hugmesh-pki` (downstreams resolve at `*.hugmesh-pki.svc.cluster.local`) |
| **`SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME`** | `hugmesh-pki-gateway` (set in the `Dockerfile`; selects this instance's route-access rows) |
| **Listen port** | `8080` (the gateway itself, `EXPOSE`d in the `Dockerfile`); downstreams are Casdoor `:8000` and headscale `:8080` |
| **Ingress** | `nginx-internal` — cluster-internal only, never internet-facing |
| **Sibling gateways** | `hugmesh-be-gateway` (API + matrix + mastodon), `hugmesh-fe-gateway` (host + remotes) |

## What it routes

The route table is config-driven (`application-pki.yml`, mirrored into the
`gateway_routes` Liquibase seed). All four routes **this repo configures** are
identity-tier downstreams in the `hugmesh-pki` namespace (the actual deployed
table has two more — see the callout below):

*Solid arrows are this gateway's own proxied routes; dashed arrows show why
the sibling gateways depend on the Casdoor this gateway fronts (they validate
JWTs it mints, per [How it relates](#how-it-relates-to-the-gateways--casdoor--federation--multi-tenancy)
below) — they do not send traffic through this gateway itself.*

| Route id | Predicate | Downstream | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `casdoor-auth` | `Path=/api/auth/**` | Casdoor `:8000` | OAuth2 / token endpoints |
| `casdoor-login` | `Path=/login/**` | Casdoor `:8000` | hosted login UI |
| `casdoor-oidc` | `Path=/.well-known/**` | Casdoor `:8000` | OIDC discovery / JWKS |
| `headscale` | `Host=scale.hugmesh.net` | headscale `:8080` | tailnet / VPN control plane |

`CASDOOR_URI`, `CASDOOR_ISSUER_URI`, and `HEADSCALE_URI` are env-overridable
(defaults point at the in-namespace services). `CASDOOR_ISSUER_URI` is the
issuer the OAuth2 resource server validates JWTs against.

## Role gates (inherited from the shared image)

Authorization is enforced by the shared gateway code, not re-implemented here.
After Spring Security authenticates the Casdoor JWT, the per-gateway
external-access gate consults the admin-managed `gateway_route_access` rows for
`hugmesh-pki-gateway` (the `gateway_route_access` table is the source of
truth, applied by the shared `GatewayRouteAccessFilter`). When neither Postgres
nor Cassandra is reachable the gate falls back to the **baked-in canonical
seed** for this tier (so it is never silently fail-open):

| URL pattern | Role |
|-------------|------|
| `/api/auth/**` | `ROLE_USER` |
| `/login/**` | `PUBLIC` (anonymous-allowed) |
| `/.well-known/**` | `PUBLIC` (anonymous-allowed) |

Login and OIDC discovery are deliberately `PUBLIC` so an unauthenticated visitor
can reach the login page and a client can fetch JWKS; the token surface floors
to `ROLE_USER`. Infra/observability paths (`/actuator/**`, …) stay gated to
`GAME-MASTER` / `ADMIN` / `SUPERADMIN` by the shared `SecurityConfig`.

> **`GAME-MASTER` is the games-tier name of the platform `MOD` authority** in
> the canonical `superadmin → admin → mod → user` cascade. The shared image's
> `Roles.isGameMaster()` matches the literal Casdoor role name `GAME-MASTER` /
> `GAME_MASTER` (both spellings), and `SecurityConfig` / the route-access and
> resource-access filters gate and own-domain-bypass on exactly that name — so
> this doc uses `GAME-MASTER` where it is naming what the inherited code emits,
> not a typo for `MOD`.

> **What is provided here vs by the shared image.** The route-access rows and
> the baked-in canonical seed/fallback above are **provided and enforced by the
> shared `hugmesh-gateway` base image** (and CRUD'd at runtime by admin-bff —
> see [Source of truth](#source-of-truth)). THIS repo only seeds the
> `gateway_routes` *route-definition* table
> ([`liquibase/changelog/001-gateway-routes.xml`](liquibase/changelog/001-gateway-routes.xml));
> it does **not** ship any `gateway_route_access` seed of its own.

## How it relates to the gateways / Casdoor / federation / multi-tenancy

- **Casdoor (auth) lives behind this gateway.** This is the door every other
  tier's tokens come from: the be/fe gateways and BFFs validate JWTs *minted*
  by the Casdoor this gateway fronts. The platform runs **one Casdoor per
  brand**, so the cryptographically-validated `iss` claim is the trustworthy
  tenant discriminator.
- **Opaque-session bridge (inherited from the shared image).** The browser
  never holds a Casdoor JWT. login-ui drives a Casdoor OIDC authorization-code
  (PKCE) redirect and user-bff performs the server-side code→token exchange,
  holding per-session JWT custody/refresh; the browser only ever carries an
  **opaque `bff_`-prefixed session**. A pre-security exchange filter in the
  shared gateway code swaps `bff_` → the internal custody JWT before Spring
  Security runs, so this gateway stays a **pure Casdoor-JWT OAuth2 resource
  server** and its JWT validation + role gate run unchanged. This overlay
  inherits that behavior from the base image; nothing about it is configured
  here beyond `CASDOOR_ISSUER_URI`.
- **Issuer-keyed domain scoping (foundation on the shared image).** The shared
  `CasdoorAuthorities` converter stamps every authenticated principal with
  exactly one issuer-derived `DOMAIN_<x>` authority (a non-role authority,
  `DOMAIN_default` on single-issuer clusters), resolved through the
  `DomainRegistry` from the validated issuer — never a user-settable claim. A
  reserved-prefix guard drops any `permissions` entry beginning `ROLE_` /
  `DOMAIN_`, closing the authority-injection / cross-domain-escalation hole.
- **Least-privilege cascade.** `SUPERADMIN > ADMIN > MOD > USER` (the
  games-tier name for `MOD` is `GAME-MASTER` — see the note under
  [Role gates](#role-gates-inherited-from-the-shared-image)). `SUPERADMIN`
  is the only cross-domain bypass (the infra control plane); `ADMIN` /
  `GAME-MASTER` bypass only within their own domain; and any non-superadmin
  whose `DOMAIN_<x>` does not match the request's target brand is hard-denied
  before the grant layer is even consulted. `ROLE_IMAGE_BUILDER` is a separate
  per-domain capability.
- **Multi-brand.** A per-brand instance is named `${BRAND}-pki-gateway`; the
  shared image derives its tier (and the right seed) by the `-pki-gateway`
  suffix, so a runtime-added brand gateway is closed-by-default until its
  Postgres rows load. headscale gives the platform its Tailscale-only federated
  reach for remote modules and the superadmin tailnet console.

## Source of truth

The route table and per-instance config that actually run in the cluster come
from the generator's ArgoCD Application
[`specs/cluster/apps/20-gateway-pki.yaml`](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-generator/blob/main/specs/cluster/apps/20-gateway-pki.yaml),
which renders the shared `hugmesh-gateway` Helm chart with `instance.name:
hugmesh-pki-gateway` and the pki `routes`. The admin-bff
(`hugmesh-admin-bff-api`) CRUDs the `gateway_route_access` rows. This repo's
`application-pki.yml` and `liquibase/changelog` are the standalone/local-dev
mirror of that same identity; keep them in sync with the generator Application,
which stays the deployed source of truth.

## Known Gaps / TODO

- **This repo's route table is missing the deployed `signup-gate` routes.**
  The generator's ArgoCD Application
  ([`specs/cluster/apps/20-gateway-pki.yaml`](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-generator/blob/main/specs/cluster/apps/20-gateway-pki.yaml)) —
  the same file this README calls the deployed source of truth for the route
  table — renders **six** routes, not the four in `application-pki.yml` /
  the Liquibase seed: it puts `signup-gate-signup` (`/api/signup`) and
  `signup-gate-login` (`/api/login`) ahead of the `casdoor-*` routes, proxying
  through the pre-signup confusable/uniqueness gate (see the note under
  ["What it routes"](#what-it-routes)). Neither this repo's YAML nor its
  Liquibase seed models `signup-gate`, so they are not just missing a literal
  value here — they are missing two whole routes, and a gateway stood up from
  only this repo's local-dev mirror would let signup/login traffic bypass the
  confusable-name gate. Fixing this needs a `SIGNUP_GATE_URI` env-overridable
  default plus two more route entries/seed rows, mirroring the generator
  Application's ordering (signup-gate routes **before** `casdoor-auth`).
- **Liquibase seed rows still cannot see an env override — but they can no
  longer drift *silently*.** The `gateway_routes` insert statements in
  [`liquibase/changelog/001-gateway-routes.xml`](liquibase/changelog/001-gateway-routes.xml)
  hardcode the Casdoor/headscale URIs as plain literals — Liquibase XML does
  not support Spring's `${VAR:default}` relaxed-binding syntax used in
  `application-pki.yml` — so a `CASDOOR_URI` or `HEADSCALE_URI` env override
  applied at deploy time still does **not** propagate to these seeded fallback
  rows. That half is unchanged, and templating the seed (envsubst before
  Liquibase runs) remains the only route to a single source of truth. What is
  fixed is the silence: the two files' **defaults** are now compared by
  [`scripts/check-route-seed-drift.py`](scripts/check-route-seed-drift.py) in
  the pipeline's `check` stage (see [CI](#ci)), so changing one and forgetting
  the other fails the build instead of shipping. Keeping them in step is still
  a manual edit — see the changeSet comment in that file and the "Source of
  truth" section above.

## CI

The only pipeline is [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml), on the privileged
`hugmesh-x86` runner:

- **`check`** — `check:route-seed-drift` runs
  [`scripts/check-route-seed-drift.py`](scripts/check-route-seed-drift.py),
  which resolves each `${VAR:default}` in `application-pki.yml` down to its
  default and compares route id, uri and predicates — in order — against the
  effective `gateway_routes` rows the Liquibase changelogs seed, failing the
  build on any disagreement. Runs on the default branch, a tag, and merge
  requests. The script is stdlib-only Python (no PyYAML), so the job needs
  nothing but a bare `python` image, and it mounts the checkout read-only.
- **`build`** — `build:image` bases off the sibling `hugmesh-gateway` image
  (`GATEWAY_IMAGE` build-arg) and pushes this overlay to the in-cluster GitLab
  registry, only on the default branch or a tag. No keys are baked in.

**CI is GitLab-only** — there are intentionally no GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/`) in this repo, in line with the platform's CI = GitLab
ONLY standard.

## Testing

This is a **config-only overlay with no source or tests of its own**. All
gateway behavior — the security filter chain, RBAC, the issuer-keyed
domain-scoping converter, the `bff_`→JWT exchange filter, and the route-access /
resource-access filters (including the `GAME-MASTER`/`ADMIN` own-domain bypass
and the reserved-prefix guard) — is unit- and e2e-tested in
[hugmesh-gateway](https://github.com/hugmesh/hugmesh-gateway).
What this repo contributes is the route config (`application-pki.yml`) and the
`gateway_routes` seed; the meaningful check here is that they stay in sync with
the deployed generator Application (see [Source of truth](#source-of-truth)).
The half of that which is verifiable from inside this repo — the route config
and the seed agreeing with **each other** — is enforced by
[`scripts/check-route-seed-drift.py`](scripts/check-route-seed-drift.py) in the
pipeline's `check` stage (see [CI](#ci)); agreement with the generator
Application itself is still checked by eye. An
earlier branch carried Java source and a Playwright/Gherkin e2e suite; those
were removed when the repo was refactored into a pure thin overlay and now live
in the shared gateway repo.

## Current State

- **Ecosystem baseline.** The fleet now runs **Spring Boot 4.0.7 / Spring Cloud
  2025.1.2** on **Java 25 LTS** (`eclipse-temurin:25`), with shared Maven
  artifacts `hugmesh-parent` (metapom
  2.7.0), `hugmesh-commons` (shared security/tenancy, `systems.hugmesh.commons.*`,
  2.7.0) and the new `hugmesh-auth-core` (2.3.0, shared
  account/session/MFA/Casdoor-admin infra; consumed by user-bff and admin-bff
  only — **not** by this gateway). This overlay carries no Java of its own, so
  it inherits the baseline entirely through the shared `hugmesh-gateway`
  base image; there is no Boot-version pin in this repo.
- **Auth model (live this cycle).** Casdoor is the SSO IdP. login-ui runs the
  OIDC authorization-code (PKCE) redirect; **user-bff** performs the
  server-side code→token exchange and holds per-session JWT custody/refresh; the
  browser only ever holds an opaque `bff_` session. The gateway remains a pure
  Casdoor-JWT resource server, with the shared image's pre-security exchange
  filter swapping `bff_` → the internal custody JWT. Login/session/account
  *logic* is being relocated from admin-bff to user-bff (shared core extracted
  to `hugmesh-auth-core`); the account/session **data** stays in
  admin-bff-db, reached by user-bff over mTLS + `X-Internal-Token`. None of this
  is configured in this repo — it is named here only so the docs match the
  current platform reality and do **not** imply login lives in admin-bff.
- **Authorization data path.** `gateway_route_access` (Postgres) is the source
  of truth, applied by the shared `GatewayRouteAccessFilter`; ADMIN /
  GAME-MASTER bypass within their own domain, SUPERADMIN cross-domain.
- **SCG-5 route namespace.** SCG 5.0 moved static route config to
  `spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.routes`; `application-pki.yml` has been
  migrated off the legacy `spring.cloud.gateway.routes` prefix (see the note
  under [What it routes](#what-it-routes)). The deployed Postgres-backed
  `gateway_routes` path is unaffected.
- **Cloudflare** fronts prod (this gateway stays internal-only behind it).
- Everything in the sections above is shipped on `main`.

## Roadmap

State legend: ✅ shipped (on `main`) · 🚧 in-flight (open branch/PR, not merged) ·
🔭 planned (design only). Everything documented above is ✅ shipped. The remaining
items below are **not** yet enforced by this overlay — either because they have
not landed yet (🚧 / 🔭, arriving via the shared `hugmesh-gateway` image and
admin-bff changelogs, which this repo inherits when those ship), or because they
**have** landed upstream and are inherited here but **ship dark behind a
default-off flag** (marked ✅, with the flag named in the bullet).

- ✅ **SCG-5 static-route prefix rename.** `application-pki.yml` migrated from
  `spring.cloud.gateway.routes` to `spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.routes`
  so the static config binds routes under Boot 4 / SCG 5 (matches the sibling
  be-/fe-/hugmesh-gateway configs). The deployed Postgres `gateway_routes`
  path already worked; this fixes the image's baked static config too.
- ✅ **`docker build .` profile activation.** The `Dockerfile` now sets
  `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=pki` in addition to `SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL_LOCATION`,
  so `application-pki.yml` (a profile-specific `application-{profile}.yml`
  document) actually loads and the built image carries the casdoor/headscale
  routes instead of falling back to the base image's packaged `api-default`
  route. Same bug class as the fleet-wide gap already fixed for the
  local-compose stack and the Helm chart (`generator#261` / `generator#275`).
- 🚧 **SSO end-to-end + e2e.** The Casdoor OIDC → user-bff custody-JWT →
  opaque `bff_` session flow (with the gateway's `bff_`→JWT exchange filter) is
  being brought up live end-to-end and covered by e2e. The gateway behavior is
  in the shared image; this overlay inherits it.
- ✅ **MFA-required route enforcement — shipped upstream, ships dark.** The
  enforcement machinery has landed and this overlay already inherits it; it is
  **feature-flagged off**, not absent. `gateway_route_access` carries a
  fail-closed `mfa_required` column (added by admin-bff Liquibase
  `001-gateway-route-access.xml`, `NOT NULL DEFAULT false`, so every existing row
  is `false`), and a deciding grant on a row with `mfa_required=true`
  additionally demands the `MFA_SATISFIED` marker — absent marker means
  **denied**. The D8 privileged-MFA floor sits *above* the `SUPERADMIN`
  cross-domain bypass, so even a `SUPERADMIN` reaching an `mfa_required` surface
  without a fresh second factor is denied.

  `MFA_SATISFIED` is **not** a role and **not** a permission: it is a non-role
  marker derived solely from the **BFF-written, freshness-validated
  `mfa_satisfied_at` JWT-Custom claim** (epoch-millis as a string, stamped by the
  BFF on a successful MFA challenge). A stamp is fresh iff
  `0 <= now - ts <= app.mfa.freshness-window` (default `600000`, 10 minutes); a
  **future** timestamp is rejected as clock-skew/forged-future. A forged
  `permissions:["MFA_SATISFIED"]` is dropped by the reserved-authority-prefix
  guard, and the missing `ROLE_` prefix means the marker can never accidentally
  satisfy a role check.

  **MFA is still not enforced on identity-tier routes today**, because both
  `app.mfa.enabled` and `app.mfa.enforce-privileged-floor` default `false` — when
  off, the `mfa_required` column is inert. What remains is the platform-wide half:
  MFA enrollment / step-up (WebAuthn + TOTP + recovery, per-role defaults; the
  admin-bff `150`–`152` substrate/factors/WebAuthn changelogs are merged), the
  admin-bff-managed `mfa_required` rows for the identity-tier routes, and flipping
  the two flags. Nothing in this overlay changes either way.
- ✅ **Continuous-OWASP security CI stage — DECIDED: this overlay is EXEMPT.**
  The platform pen-test standard adds a shared `.gitlab-ci.yml` `include`
  (ZAP DAST + Dependency-Check SCA + nuclei + k6) to app/service repos.
  Decision (2026-07 hygiene pass): gateway-config overlays like this repo are
  **exempted**, for two verifiable reasons. (1) This repo contains no
  dependency manifest and no application code — only a `Dockerfile`,
  `application-pki.yml`, and Liquibase changelogs — so a Dependency-Check SCA
  job here would scan nothing and report a vacuous green. (2) Every byte of
  runtime behavior comes from the shared `hugmesh-gateway` image, whose own
  repo carries the full pen-test stage jobs (`pentest:sca` + `pentest:dast`
  extending the centralized generator template — see that repo for the current
  execution status of its DAST leg); a DAST run from this repo would re-scan
  that sibling artifact, double-counting coverage without testing anything this
  overlay adds. **Revisit trigger:** if this overlay ever gains its own
  dependency manifest or app surface (anything beyond config/changelogs), it
  MUST adopt the shared `include` like the app/service repos.
